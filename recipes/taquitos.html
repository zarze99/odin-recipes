    <h1>Chicken Taquitos Recipe</h1>
    <img src="../images/taquitos.webp" alt="Image of Chicken Taquitos">
    <p>From Allrecipes: "Smoked cheese and green salsa give these crispy chicken taquitos that extra yum!
         Thinner corn tortillas will work the best.
          If you can't find the smoked cheese blend in your area,
         try using regular smoked Cheddar or Monterey Jack cheese."</p>
          <p>The beginning and end of my experience with taquitos is the ones you buy in the freezer section of walmart, you know the ones.
            The ones that you pop in the air fryer you got as a wedding gift 3 years ago and use once in a blue moon, then when you retrieve the boiling cheese and chicken torpedos they burn you. the meanies.
